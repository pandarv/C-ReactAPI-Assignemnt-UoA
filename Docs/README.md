# **EXSM 3946: C# React API - Project**

- Home page is present.
- API Endpoint for each Models are accessed.
- On clicking the buttons of each Model first it fetches the GET section of CRUD as a list. The did not change the Foreign Key IDs as Name.
- POST section is as a form with Add button. The Error message displays for 10 seconds in red color received from server of not found or bad request. Although, I have provided frontend error handling in Dealership Model section.
- DELETE section is simply in coral color on each row of the table.
- PUT section in each row as EDIT button in blue color opens in new page where all the old details displayed as placeholder. All the fields needs to be filled out, if needs to be changed. Click the Edit button to update the row.
- React Router is used for linking all the pages.
- Fixed the bug of server error display in Edit section.
- Display of name of FK items instead of IDs.
